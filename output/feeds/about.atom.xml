My story is one of innovation by necessity. I have always enjoyed math, but have never been particularity good at it, but technology has allowed me to appreciate things in the world that I would have never dreamed of. Up to college, I struggled through all my math classes until I learned how handy spreadsheets are for calculating things. I considered myself handy with Excel, until I stumbled across VBA (Visual Basic for Applications). It was an eye opening experience, like a sawless carpenter discovering a serrated metal blade for the first time. I found programming to be enjoyable and extremely useful for my industrial and mechanical engineering classes. I picked up MATLAB when I actually wanted to do math, and was excellent for linear algebra and numerical methods, which are be very tedious to do by hand (and can be difficult conceptually). 
After college, I found myself wanting to do some programming projects, but not wanting to buy a license. This led me to taking a coursera class, and fumbling through picking up python and linux, and have love (almost) every minute of it. Two years later, I started this blog, and have been a recovering MATLAB user trying to transition to the open-source world, and python has been my gateway, and I have yet to be disappointed. You want to perform engineering calculations? Build a website? Write scripts for Excel, Solidworks, CATIA, Abaqus? Smart Home/Office automation (ehem, Raspberry Pi...)? I had finally found the tool I was looking for.
I hope to share some of my frustrations in the world of technology, and maybe beyond, so that others can experience what the open-source world is about and hang out in the open-source 'bazaar' with me. I have had so much help online with so many different challenges I have faced, and I hope that this will help one or two people out there. I also find that slowing down every day and just writing, something, helps me channel my thoughts and motivations, and I think this will be an excellent chance to help me to keep writing.
So, I hope to be of help to other through tutorials of handy tools I have found or made, as well as share my adventure in the world of programming, linux, open-source mindsets, and getting people interesting in science, engineering and math and showing some tools to help scratch their curiosity itches &lt;/p&gt;
