    "#Motivation\n",
    "Python is my favorite lanugauge. But, I also practice polyglottery(using multiple languages...I know, I had to use that word!). For the years of using python, I have rarely come across a problem that I haven't been able to solve or hasn't been solved yet in python. Well, today is the day. \n",
    "\n",
    "I enjoy statistics, and a very useful tool in the statisticians toolbox is the Experimental Design, or DOE (Design of Experiments). I searched for hours trying to find an open-source alternative to the Minitab DOE package, which is nice if you have a license, and found limited options. I evaluted [pyDOE](http://pythonhosted.org/pyDOE/), but it only designs experiments, not analyzes them. There are a couple open-source statistics packages, such as [sofa](http://www.sofastatistics.com/home.php), but why would you use anything other than R? Yes, I know the answer, because it is a programming lanugage, not a nice GUI. Well, I encourage you to make the plunge, because I haven't been impressed with a programming language in a long time, and R has impressed me. \n",

    "I assume you are familiar with DOE principles. If not, check out a [R-DOE-book](https://www.crcpress.com/Design-and-Analysis-of-Experiments-with-R/Lawson/9781439868133  \n",
    ") or for theory, [Design and Analysis of Experiments by Montgomery](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP002024.html) is a classic. As for R, you don't need to be an expert, but it helps to play around with it, perhaps some [golf](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/r).\n",

    "Fortunatley some awesome GUI's already exist. [rkward](https://rkward.kde.org/) is cool, but I prefer [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). RStudio has a built in script editor, a console for running commands, a plot window, a file explorer, and a help window. Take some time and familiarize yourself with RStudio.\n",

We can install all the packages from our R program. \n",

    "# Design of Experiements\n",
    "\n",
    "For the total newbie, a experimental design is a statical method for modeling a system, especially a complex system that is not easily analytically modeled. The system will have some given inputs, or factors, and outputs, or responses. The goal is to determine what factors are significant in the contribution to the effect of the response(s). Since our experiment is emperical, we expect some level of error, but that is OK because the statistical significance will be one of the results we will obtain.\n",
    "For DOE experts, sorry about my simple explaination. I am an engineer, not a statistician. For this experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "The screening experiment we will be running is to model the factors or variables when operating a potato gun. We will do a handful of runs, or shots with the gun, and see what is contributing to the distance, positivley or negatively. This allows us to run as few runs as possible to find any significant factors. We will start with 8 factors, with 2 levels, and one response, distance. That may seem like a lot of runs to the naive experimenter, actually $2^8=256$ combinations, or full-factorial. If that is done, you will quickly lose interest, money, or supporters by taking so long. So, before we run an experiment that detailed, we should screen out the insignificant factors first.\n",

The syntax is fine, the packages are numerous, and the community is good.\n",
