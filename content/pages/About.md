Authors: Neal Gordon

I am finally getting around to creating a blog. My motivation is of innovation by necessity. Technology has allowed me to appreciate things in the world that I would have never dreamed of. This site is a journey of mine learning, new technologies to help me better understand the work, often from an engineering perspective. 
I enjoy wearing many hats. Professionally I consider myself a mechanical engineer with a focus on computer aided engineering and materials/solid-mechanics, but also enjoy software development and process engineering. My hobbies include sailing, aviation (gliding, powered, RC), soccer,... (and could go on for days). I am a nascent linux user and passionate about the open-source world.
I hope to share some of my frustrations in the world of technology, and maybe beyond. I also find that slowing down every day and just writing, something, helps me channel my thoughts and motivations, and I think this will be an excellent chance to help me to keep writing.
So, I hope to be of help to other through tutorials of handy tools I have found or made, as well as share my adventure in the world of engineering, math, programming, linux, open-source things, and whatever else I find interesting. I am also very interested in STEM education and getting people interesting in science, engineering and math and showing some tools to help scratch their curiosity itches, so my posts may very greatly in technical degree. Thanks for reading!
