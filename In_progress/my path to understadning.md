I am finally getting around to creating a blog. My motivation is of innovation by necessity. I have always enjoyed math and found it very satisifying to understand, but have never been particularity talented at it, but technology has allowed me to appreciate things in the world that I would have never dreamed of. Up to college, I struggled through all my math classes until I learned how handy spreadsheets are for calculating things. I considered myself handy with Excel, until I stumbled across VBA (Visual Basic for Applications). It was an eye opening experience, like a sawless carpenter discovering a serrated metal blade for the first time. I found programming to be enjoyable and extremely useful for my industrial and mechanical engineering classes. I picked up MATLAB when I actually wanted to do math, and was excellent for linear algebra and numerical methods, which are be very tedious to do by hand (and can be difficult conceptually). 
After college, I found myself wanting to do some programming projects, but not wanting to pay for licensing for other proprietary programs(eg, MATLAB, mathematica, maple, mathcad, etc). This led me to taking a [coursera class](https://www.coursera.org/course/scientificcomp), and while I fumbled through picking up python and linux, I loved (almost) every minute of it. Two years later and many many hours of goofing around with python, I started this blog and haven't looked back. The only personal resistance I have found is all the legacy prgorams I have and need to reprogram in python. Recovering as a MATLAB user trying to transition to the open-source world has been much easier with python as my gateway, and I have yet to be disappointed. You want to perform engineering calculations? Build a website? Write scripts for Excel, Solidworks, CATIA, Abaqus? Smart Home/Office automation (ehem, Raspberry Pi...)? I had finally found the tool I was looking for.
I hope to share some of my frustrations in the world of technology, and maybe beyond, so that others can experience what the open-source world is about and hang out in the open-source 'bazaar' with me. I have had so much help online with so many different challenges I have faced, and I hope that this will help one or two people out there. I also find that slowing down every day and just writing, something, helps me channel my thoughts and motivations, and I think this will be an excellent chance to help me to keep writing.
So, I hope to be of help to other through tutorials of handy tools I have found or made, as well as share my adventure in the world of programming, linux, open-source mindsets, and getting people interesting in science, engineering and math and showing some tools to help scratch their curiosity itches
